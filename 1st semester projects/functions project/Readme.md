## About the Project
this project has a menu-based interface with login functionality and multiple exercises in different categories.  
The main goal of the project was to learn and use functions, loops, conditionals, arrays, and switch statements in a structured way.

I was tasked to write five main functions, each covering different programming concepts.  
Each function had multiple smaller tasks:  
1. **Loop-Based Function:** Tasks like printing sequences, sums, or patterns.  
2. **If-Else Function:** Tasks that required decisions based on user input.  
3. **Switch Function:** Tasks that handled multiple choices using switch-case.  
4. **Array Function:** Tasks like finding sum, average, or maximum in an array.  
5. **Combined Function Task:** Tasks that used loops, conditions, and arrays together.  

- Secure login with ID and password.  
- Menu-driven interface to choose exercises easily.  
- Interactive exercises covering **loops, if-else, switch, arrays, and functions**.  
- Options to go back to the menu or retry exercises.  
- Simple and clear output to guide the user.

## My Experience
This was one of my first big C++ projects, and it was both difficult for me and fun having no special knowledge about programming it boosted my confidence in programming.  
I learned a lot while working on it:  

- How to **use functions** to organize code.  
- How to use **loops, conditionals, and switch statements**.  
- How to work with **arrays** and perform simple calculations.  
- How to make the program **user-friendly** and easy to navigate.  
- How to **debug problems** and think logically.  

Completing this project gave me confidence and a better understanding of basic C++ programming.
